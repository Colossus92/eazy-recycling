# ADR 0001: Choose React for Frontend Development

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select a frontend technology for building user interfaces. The choice should balance ease of adoption, long-term maintainability, flexibility, and the ability to hire developers or onboard new team members efficiently.

## Considered Options
•	React
•	Low-code tools (e.g., OutSystems, Mendix, Bubble)
•	Vue.js
•	Server-side templating (e.g., Thymeleaf, JSP, etc.)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: React.
React is the industry standard for frontend development, which ensures:
•	Easy knowledge transfer between projects and developers.
•	Large talent pool for future hiring.
•	Wide ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support.

This makes it a safe and future-proof choice for building and maintaining our frontend applications.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### React

Pros
•	De facto industry standard, very popular.
•	Large ecosystem (libraries, tooling, frameworks like Next.js).
•	Easy to hire developers with React experience.
•	Active community and long-term support.

Cons
•	Requires a build toolchain (not as simple as backend templating).
•	Can result in over-engineering if not well-structured.

⸻

### Low-code tools (OutSystems, Mendix, Bubble)

Pros
•	Very fast initial development.
•	Visual development can lower entry barrier.

Cons
•	Lack of flexibility for custom features.
•	Vendor lock-in.
•	Limited community and talent pool compared to React.
•	Less suitable for complex, evolving applications.

⸻

### Vue.js

Pros
•	Modern, lightweight, approachable framework.
•	Clean syntax and smaller learning curve for some developers.
•	Growing ecosystem.

Cons
•	Learning curve for current team (React knowledge more common).
•	Smaller talent pool compared to React.
•	Less widely adopted in enterprise environments.

⸻

### Server-side templating

Pros
•	Simple, mature, and easy to set up.
•	No need for a heavy frontend build pipeline.

Cons
•	Outdated approach for modern, interactive UIs.
•	Harder to reuse frontend skills across projects.
•	Limited flexibility for rich client-side interactions.
